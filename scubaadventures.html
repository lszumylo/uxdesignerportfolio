  <h2 class="problem">The Problem</h2>
</div>

<p class="sample">Scuba Diving is a great way to explore the world we live in, with so many locations and diving types available it would take several lifetimes to see it all. Today's technology allows you to book your next excursion in minutes and explore your dive site within hours. However, efficiently researching and booking dive locations can be limited unless you have a specific destination in mind or are opting to stay at a dedicated diving resort</p>

<div>
  <h2 class="solution">The Solution</h2>

  <p class="explanation">Scuba Adventures, an ecommerce site providing exceptional global diving and liveaboard rates. Offering expert insights on dive sites, country-specific requirements, and comprehensive information, our tailored pricing for each location guarantees worry-free exploration without concerns of overpaying.</p>

  <p class="result">I created two Google surveys aimed at gathering valuable insights into diving habits. These surveys focus on determining the frequency of diving throughout the year, preferred diving destinations, trip durations, equipment ownership versus rental preferences, and the typical group size for diving expeditions.</p>

   <p class="swot">
   <br>
    Analyzing the survey data, I conducted an in-depth assessment of three leading Scuba Diving Companies. My focus was on understanding their offerings, target audience, commonalities, and unique attributes. By evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, I aim to discern how this site can distinguish itself in the competitive diving market. Let's explore these insights further!

<h2 class="user-stories-sa">User Stories</h2>

<p class="crossover-stories-sa">
  I've created two sets of user stories based on our survey findings: one representing what users expect from a dive website, and the other detailing the business goals. As I analyzed these, I found some shared aspects between what consumers want and what the business aims to achieve. Below, I've listed the findings that overlap between both consumer expectations and business objectives.

<h2 class="our-users">Our Users</h2>
<p class="user-details">The survey findings revealed three significant groups within our audienceâ€”those in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Leveraging this data, I developed three distinct personas that explore their particular goals, challenges, and motivations when exploring dive sites in depth.</p>

<div class="user-testing-container">

<h2 class="user-testing-sa">User Testing & Results Summary</h2>

<p>Three individuals participated in testing the Scuba Adventures website, comprising one male and two females with ages ranging from the mid-20s to late 40s. Each user conducted the tests on a desktop platform. The testing procedure involved completing three specific tasks and lasted approximately 10 minutes from initiation to completion.</p>

<p>Tasks included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Booking a diving trip.</li>
  <li>Submitting a quote.</li>
  <li>Locating the option to add a review.</li>
</ul>
   <br>

  <h3 class="problem1">Problem #1</h3>

  <p class="problem1-explanation">The primary usability concern encountered by all three users was related to misunderstanding the functionality of the 'Reservation'button. When prompted to book a reservation, all testers attempted to access the 'Reservation' button located at the top of the screen. However, it was not yet clickable because I intended it as a feature to review existing purchases. All three users assumed it was meant for initiating a new reservation rather than checking or reviewing an already made reservation.</p>
  <br>

  <h3 class="problem2">Problem #2</h3>

  <p class="problem2-explanation">During testing, a minor yet crucial concern arose when a user expressed uncertainty regarding the confirmation of their message submission. The absence of any indication that the message was successfully received by the company led to uncertainty. Similarly, this issue surfaced during the 'submit a quote' task, where the user lacked confirmation that the quote had been successfully sent to the company.</p>
  <br>
</div>


<h3 class="results">Results & Next Steps</h3>

<p class="results-explanation">In reviewing the user testing outcomes, all three users navigated the screens successfully and completed the tasks without encountering significant issues. The workflow appeared straightforward, facilitating an easy understanding of the process.

While users managed to proceed without major obstacles, certain aspects require refinement and restructuring. Overall, the users expressed contentment with the experience and demonstrated adaptability in navigating around identified issues to accomplish their goals.

My plan involves addressing the common major issues encountered by all three users. This will involve revising the structure and wording to enhance the clarity of each buttons purpose and content. Subsequently, I intend to conduct a retest to evaluate if the adjustments have positively influenced the overall outcome.</p>

<h3 class="logo-sketch">Logo Sketches</h3>
<p class="logo-explanation">I began by sketching out 8-10 logo ideas, carefully refining them until I settled on 2 standout concepts. These two were further developed with multiple variations, seeking valuable input from peers and mentors. After receiving feedback and considering various perspectives, I arrived at a final design that's perfectly suited for all marketing needs, ensuring its visual impact remains consistent whether on a small business card or a large billboard</p>

      <h3 class="color-palette">Color Palette & Typography</h3>
      <p class="style-guide-explanation">Creating my color palette was a straightforward process. I opted for fundamental oceanic hues, complemented by additional colors to distinguish it from competitors.
      <br>
      When considering typography, I initially opted for Roboto. However, its compatibility with Gabriela didn't align well during logo design. I switched gears to Muli for both the website and logo. However, acknowledging the unique requirements of the logo, I ultimately chose Open Sans for the site due to its versatility in font styles, while Muli remained the designated font for the logo.</p>
     
      <h3 class="style-tile">Style Tile</h3>
      <p class="style-tile-explanation">I consolidated all assets to craft a style tile, ensuring a unified and cohesive design approach as I transitioned into the hi-fidelity wireframes..</p>

  <h3 class="high-fid-wireframe">High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>

  <p class="high-fid-explanation">I incorporated content and images into the high-fidelity wireframes and then conducted a second round of user testing. Three individuals tested the site using the same set of questions, providing additional feedback and suggestions. This feedback guided me to make further adjustments to the design.</p>

  <h3 class="what-worked">Initial Project Perspective</h3>
  <p class="worked-explanation">Assessing the successes and challenges, the website overall accomplished its intended goals. Users could seamlessly complete tasks and appreciated the site's aesthetics. However, certain aspects required redesigning; some processes proved lengthy for users, not aligning well with their needs or the business objectives.

   When embarking on this project, I harbored no particular concerns. My choice of the topic was fueled by my passion for diving and travel. My aim was to create a platform facilitating smoother experiences for individuals seeking their next adventurous dive.</p>

  <h3 class="surprised">Unforeseen Discoveries & Areas for Enhancement</h3>
  <p class="surprised-explanation">I was pleasantly surprised by how expansive this topic became, allowing for more extensive information than initially anticipated. It often prompted me to realign with the original outline and prioritize user preferences over my assumptions.
  <br>
   Regarding improvements, I aim to ensure every listed destination includes at least one diving location. Moreover, I plan to enrich the country facts section to offer users a more comprehensive experience.</p>
