      life coach company that helps individuals clarify and achieve their goals and dreams by identifying the obstacles that hold them back.</p>
        <p class="page__section-text">The owner contacted me to design a responsive website, create a logo and brand identity so she can start to

    <p class="competitive-analysis__text">Life coaching practices have been around since the 1980’s and have been growing in popularity ever since. As lives become more demanding in both personal and professional aspects, many people seek out a life coach for guidance. Incorporating the knowledge and experience of a Life Coach may be beneficial to get an outsider's point of view on a current situation providing new solutions to the problem.</p>
    <p class="competitive-analysis__text">Based on the survey results, I took a deeper look into 4 local Life Coach Companies. I compared what they offered, who their target market is, how they are similar to one another, and what are the main differences. Listing out their strengths and weaknesses will provide me with the information to create a website that stands out against the competition. Let's take a look!</p>

The sketches outlined in gold are the client's choices that will be used moving forward in the project.

  <p class="user-testing__description">It was time to test the structure of the site. I conducted the user testing session with 4 participants. They met the requirements for the persona, ages ranged from 30’s to late 40’s and were familiar with what a life coach does.
   The tasks were focused on the 4 main goals of the site. For the purpose of this testing session, I didn’t complete the full lifecycle of the booking process. This was just to see if the users were able to find the information.</p>

<!--add logo sketches 2 images-->

<section class="task1">
  <h1 class="task1__title">Task 1 Problem Takeaways</h1>

  <p class="task1__description">Only 1 out of 4 users were able to locate the information on what a life coach does without any errors. 2 users clicked on “Services” page and 1 clicked on “About Me” page. After those attempts failed, they all found the information on the bottom of the ”Home” page.</p>

  <br>

  <h1 class="insights__title">Insights</h1>

  <p class="insights__description">After speaking with the users, I discovered that the reason they all left the home page was they didn’t think there was any more information after the “Let’s Talk” CTA button. It didn’t occur to them to try to scroll down, they just saw the other links and selected the “Services” or “ About Me” pages to try to find the information they were looking for.</p>

  <br>
  <h1 class="thoughts__title">Thoughts</h1>

  <p class="thoughts__description">Overall I think the testing went well, the 4 participants were able to complete all the tasks even after the initial slip ups of the first task. The 2nd and 3rd tasks were competed without any errors or confession. Before moving to the High Fidelity I’ll focus on reworking the home page so the users can tell there’s more information below the CTA button. This might be done by shrinking down the image, adding in an indicator such as an arrow or moving up the next section so it shows above the fold.</p>

 <p class="outcome-summary__description-hi-fi">This round of testing was successful as all participants were able to complete each of the tasks showing a 100% success rate. However, there were some repetitive comments from 4 out of 5 users about the lack of information for each package. While this didn’t directly effect the end result of completing the tasks, it did raise some concerns as to if people would book appointments due to minimal content. Another request was adding  the word “home” to the navigation bar as they forgot the logo was the linked to the “home” screen.</p>

          <p class="realizations-hi-fi__description">After speaking with each of the participants I learned that despite the errors mentioned above, they liked the website. Overall it was easy to understand, the images and colors were inviting, the content was easily scannable which was nice for quickly looking for information. The main concern that would delay booking a package was the lack of information on the services page.</p>

  <p class="ponder-hi-fi__thoughts-description">
    The testing sessions went well, with all 5 users easily completing the 6 tasks, demonstrating the website's user-friendliness. However, improvements are still needed. To address this, I'll collaborate closely with the client to gather detailed package information, reducing potential client booking hesitations. Additionally, based on testing feedback, I'll add "home" to the navigation.
    I used an affinity map to analyze and prioritize feedback, identifying common themes and distinguishing immediate action items from those requiring owner discussion.

  <p class="closing__description">With the updates completed, it’s now time to meet with the client to show her the final designs. She’ll explore her website via the prototype to get the full experience. Once she’s signed off on the design, we’ll move into the development of the website. I’ll then walk the client through how to update her site with images, text, and any basic changes she may need as she expands her business.</p>

<div class="assessment">
  <h4 class="assessmentTitle">Final Check-In</h4>
  <p class="assessmentDescription">I like to give my clients a chance to explore the new site on their own, ensuring everything works correctly without the pressure of a meeting. This allows them time to learn how to update website features and get answers to questions as they come up.</p>
  <p>I’ll schedule the check-in meeting for 3-4 weeks after the site is live, allowing time for some site traffic and the client to get comfortable making changes to the site on their own.</p>
