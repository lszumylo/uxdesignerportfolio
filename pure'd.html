</div>



<p class="project-details">I met the founder of Pure’d at a disc golf convention while he demoed his new app, designed to help players connect and schedule rounds. 
  As he walked us through the features, I noticed a few areas where the user experience could be tightened, particularly around accessibility and usability.
 I offered to conduct a quick UX audit and share my feedback, a professional gesture driven by mutual enthusiasm for the product’s growth. The app launched in 
  beta and was live in the App Store. After our conversation, I took additional time to thoroughly explore the app to ensure my feedback was well-informed and actionable. 
  The goal was to identify key friction points and opportunities to improve the overall experience.</p>
 
<div>
    <h2 class="project-resolution">UX Audit Approach</h2>
    <p class="project-proposal">Since I wasn’t part of the original design process, I approached this as a top-level heuristic review. I walked through key user flows such 
      as sign-up, profile setup, connecting with other players, and scheduling games. My focus was on usability, inclusivity, and interface consistency. I compiled my findings into a structured email, offering context, rationale, and actionable suggestions for each issue..</p>

<section class="audit-highlights">
    <h2 class="audit-highlights__title">Highlights from the Audit and Client Responses</h2>
    <p class="audit-highlights__text">To make the feedback clear and implementable, I categorized each suggestion by user experience
      theme and included rationale for each recommendation. The following section outlines the most impactful recommendations and the
      founder’s direct responses.</p>

<h3 class="clarity">Onboarding Clarity</h3> 
  <h2 class="clarity-issue"> Issue Identified:</h2>
<p class="clarity-text"> On the preference screen during sign-up, users can only determine if a field is required by clicking into it. 
  This lack of clarity can create friction and delay the onboarding process.</p>
