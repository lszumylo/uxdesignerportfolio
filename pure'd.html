    <h1 class="page-name">Pure'd </h1>
    <p class="page-intro">A beta-stage disc golf app gets a fresh perspective through a strategic UX audit focused on accessibility, usability, and growth.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2 class="theproject">The Project</h2>
</div>



<p class="project-details">I met the founder of Pure’d at a disc golf convention while he demoed his new app, designed to help players connect and schedule rounds. 
  As he walked us through the features, I noticed a few areas where the user experience could be tightened, particularly around accessibility and usability.
 I offered to conduct a quick UX audit and share my feedback, a professional gesture driven by mutual enthusiasm for the product’s growth. The app launched in 
  beta and was live in the App Store. After our conversation, I took additional time to thoroughly explore the app to ensure my feedback was well-informed and actionable. 
  The goal was to identify key friction points and opportunities to improve the overall experience.</p>
 
<div>
    <h2 class="project-resolution">UX Audit Approach</h2>
    <p class="project-proposal">Since I wasn’t part of the original design process, I approached this as a top-level heuristic review. I walked through key user flows such 
      as sign-up, profile setup, connecting with other players, and scheduling games. My focus was on usability, inclusivity, and interface consistency. I compiled my findings into a structured email, offering context, rationale, and actionable suggestions for each issue.</p>
</div>

<br>

 
<section class="audit-highlights">
    <h2 class="audit-highlights__title">Highlights from the Audit and Client Responses</h2>
    <p class="audit-highlights__text">To make the feedback clear and implementable, I categorized each suggestion by user experience
      theme and included rationale for each recommendation. The following section outlines the most impactful recommendations and the
      founder’s direct responses.</p>
</section>

  <br>
 
<h2 class="clarity">Onboarding Clarity</h2> 
  <h3 class="clarity-issue"> Issue Identified:</h3>
<p class="clarity-text"> On the preference screen during sign-up, users can only determine if a field is required by clicking into it. 
  This lack of clarity can create friction and delay the onboarding process.</p>
 
<br>
 
 <h3 class="clarity-recommendation"> Recommendation:</h3>
 <p class="clarity-details">  Enhance the sign-up experience by clearly distinguishing required from optional information. Group “required details” 
  at the top of the form, and place “optional” fields below. When requesting necessary details, include a brief explanation to help users understand 
  why the information is needed. This approach promotes transparency and helps users quickly assess the time and information commitment during setup, 
  supporting a smoother, more user-friendly onboarding experience.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <h3 class="clarity-response"> Client Response:</h3>
 <p class="clarity-client-words"> “I like the idea of calling out required fields and supporting those fields with an explanation.”</p>

 <br> 

 <h2 class="optimizing"> Optimizing Local Connections</h2> 
  <h3 class="optimizing-issue"> Issue Identified:</h3>
<p class="optimizing-text"> User location is currently determined by the “home course” address, which can be misleading for connecting locally.</p>
 
<br>
 <h3 class="optimizing-recommendation"> Recommendation:</h3>
  <p class="optimizing-details"> In the Connect section, I observed that the location of the player is labeled as the "home course" address. What 
   if this showcases the user's city or town instead? This modification could streamline local connections by allowing users to connect based on their
   physical proximity rather than a specific course, enriching the potential for meaningful interactions.

   <br>
   
 <h3 class="optimizing-response"> Client Response:</h3>
 <p class="optimizing-client-words"> “This is one of the biggest pain points being addressed. I intended to have the user’s Zip Code, entered during
  onboarding, determine their City/State and distance from rounds. Not sure what happened, but the zip code field doesn’t serve a function, and as you
  noticed, it uses the ‘Home Course’ for user's location, which is problematic. The solution will likely involve selecting your Country, City, & State 
  during onboarding.”</p>
