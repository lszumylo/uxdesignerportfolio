Be Ready Fitness


Be Ready Fitness is a dynamic personal training studio nestled in Bedford, MA. Tailored for busy professionals, the studio is dedicated to helping individuals achieve their fitness goals by offering top-notch workouts crafted to suit diverse schedules and aspirations.


The Problem

The owner approached me with a request to craft a company logo that resonates with their current clientele. They're in need of a logo that not only stands out prominently on the plaza sign but also retains its visual appeal when scaled down for business cards, marketing materials, and apparel.

The Solution

Craft a company logo that embodies the essence of quality workouts and embodies the achievement of client goals within busy schedules.

Research

Competitive Analysis

Initially, I gathered information about personal training studios and gyms in the Bedford area, exploring their logos, color schemes, and typography. I narrowed down the selection to the most relevant businesses, resulting in the following findings for my logo research.


Name: Get in Shape for Women
Tagline: Small Group Personal Training
Colors: Black, White, Purple

Observations:
The logo's design feels crowded within the oval space, causing the lady's image to seem squeezed and less integrated. The use of a purple outline detracts from readability and draws attention away from the text. The incomplete oval shape on the right side contributes to an unfinished appearance.

Potential Challenges:
At smaller sizes, visibility might diminish as the lady's dark image becomes harder to distinguish against the background, restricting the logo's adaptability.

Unique Aspect:
Using an icon sets this fitness logo apart. However, its placement within the overall design may not significantly enhance the logo's visual appeal.

Aspect of Concern:
The positioning of the icon within the oval structure might create distractions and doesn't fully complement the logo's aesthetic.


Name: Fitness Together
Tagline: 1 Client  1 Trainer  1 Goal
Colors: Blue, White


Observations:
The logo's oval design offers improved readability and scalability, well-suited for effective marketing purposes. Its italicized typography, although unconventional, conveys a sense of movement, possibly aligning with a fitness studio's energetic ambiance. The simple yet appealing color scheme in blue and white enhances its visual attractiveness.

Potential Challenges:
The logo's appearance resembles that of a travel destination sticker, lacking clear indications of a personal training studio. It doesn't explicitly define the studio's purpose, relying largely on the sparingly used tagline in marketing materials beyond the website.

Unique Aspect:
Standout traits include enhanced legibility, scalability, and adaptability for marketing, setting it apart from other oval fitness logos.

Aspect of Concern:
The logo's visual impression might give the perception of a travel-related emblem rather than conveying the essence of a personal training studio. Its reliance on the tagline for clarity poses a limitation due to limited usage across marketing channels


Name: Lifetime Fitness
Tagline: Healthy way of life 
Colors: Black, White, Grey 

Observations:
This logo emerges as the most powerful among the three listed. The combination of large block letters at the top with thin lettering at the bottom generates a bold and impactful design. The intentional spacing at the top and bottom of the box, instead of an even border around the title, enhances its visual appeal.

Potential Challenges:
While no significant concerns have been identified upon examination, it's worth noting that the contrast between black and white elements may pose readability issues when scaled down to smaller sizes, potentially challenging for some individuals.

Unique Aspect:
The deliberate contrast between the large block letters and thin lettering, along with the strategic spacing, contributes significantly to its bold and impactful visual representation.

Aspect of Concern:
Upon review, no specific issues or concerns have been detected.

Commonalities among all three logos:

Each of the three logos employs white lettering.
The text in all three logos is presented in uppercase.


Brand Identity

Following an extensive brainstorming session for logo ideas, I created three pages of diverse designs for the client's review. The owner narrowed down the options to one preferred logo style but requested several iterations within that design. Consequently, I produced multiple versions with different icon placements, visual arrangements, and border styles to further explore and refine the chosen design direction.

Color Selection

The color scheme for Be Ready Fitness underwent various transformations and explorations. Initially, the client considered incorporating blue, yellow, red, white, and black colors without a specific primary choice. Upon researching competitors' logos, we found that blue was a popular color among local gyms.

After experimenting with different color placements, the client opted for simplicity. The final choice narrowed down to a refined palette consisting of black and white as primary colors, accented by a bold touch of red.
