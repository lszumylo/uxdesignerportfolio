<h2 class="prob">The Problem</h2>
 </div>

<p class="example">The owner approached me with a request to craft a company logo that resonates with their current clientele. They're in need of a logo that not only stands out prominently on the plaza sign but also retains its visual appeal when scaled down for business cards, marketing materials, and apparel.</p>

<h2 class="exploration">Research</h2>
<hr style="border-color: #CD4947;" />

<h3 class="market-research">Competitive Analysis</h3> 

<p class="insight">Initially, I gathered information about personal training studios and gyms in the Bedford area, exploring their logos, color schemes, and typography. I narrowed down the selection to the most relevant businesses, resulting in the following findings for my logo research.</p>

 <!-- Details of the first company (Get in Shape for Women) -->
    <div>
        <div><b>Name:</b> Get in Shape for Women</div>
        <div><b>Tagline:</b> Small Group Personal Training</div>
        <div><b>Colors:</b> Black, White, Purple</div>

        <!-- Observations -->
        <p><b>Observations:</b></p>
        <p>The logo's design feels crowded within the oval space, causing the lady's image to seem squeezed and less integrated. The use of a purple outline detracts from readability and draws attention away from the text. The incomplete oval shape on the right side contributes to an unfinished appearance </p>

        <!-- Potential Challenges -->
        <p><b>Potential Challenges:</b></p>
        <p>At smaller sizes, visibility might diminish as the lady's dark image becomes harder to distinguish against the background, restricting the logo's adaptability.</p>

        <!-- Unique Aspect -->
        <p><b>Unique Aspect:</b></p>
        <p>Using an icon sets this fitness logo apart. However, its placement within the overall design may not significantly enhance the logo's visual appeal.</p>


        <!-- Aspects of Concern -->
        <p><b>Aspects of Concern:</b></p>
        <p>The positioning of the icon within the oval structure might create distractions and doesn't fully complement the logo's aesthetic.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Details of the second company (Fitness Together) -->
    <div>
        <div><b>Name:</b> Fitness Together</div>
        <div><b>Tagline:</b> 1 Client 1 Trainer 1 Goal</div>
        <div><b>Colors:</b> Blue, White</div>

        <b>Observations:</b>
        <p>The logo's oval design offers improved readability and scalability, well-suited for effective marketing purposes. Its italicized typography, although unconventional, conveys a sense of movement, possibly aligning with a fitness studio's energetic ambiance. The simple yet appealing color scheme in blue and white enhances its visual attractiveness.</p>

        <b>Potential Challenges:</b>
        <p>The logo's appearance resembles that of a travel destination sticker, lacking clear indications of a personal training studio. It doesn't explicitly define the studio's purpose, relying largely on the sparingly used tagline in marketing materials beyond the website.</p>

        <b>Unique Aspect:</b>
        <p>Standout traits include enhanced legibility, scalability, and adaptability for marketing, setting it apart from other oval fitness logos.</p>

        <b>Aspects of Concern:</b>
        <p>The logo's visual impression might give the perception of a travel-related emblem rather than conveying the essence of a personal training studio. Its reliance on the tagline for clarity poses a limitation due to limited usage across marketing channels.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Details of the third company (Lifetime Fitness) -->
    <div>
        <div><b>Name:</b> Lifetime Fitness</div>
        <div><b>Tagline:</b> Healthy way of life</div>
        <div><b>Colors:</b> Black, White, Grey</div>

        <b>Observations:</b>
        <p>This logo emerges as the most powerful among the three listed. The combination of large block letters at the top with thin lettering at the bottom generates a bold and impactful design. The intentional spacing at the top and bottom of the box, instead of an even border around the title, enhances its visual appeal.</p>

        <b>Potential Challenges:</b>
        <p>While no significant concerns have been identified upon examination, it's worth noting that the contrast between black and white elements may pose readability issues when scaled down to smaller sizes, potentially challenging for some individuals.</p>

        <b>Unique Aspect:</b>
        <p>The deliberate contrast between the large block letters and thin lettering, along with the strategic spacing, contributes significantly to its bold and impactful visual representation.</p>

        <b>Aspects of Concern:</b>
        <p>No specific issues or concerns have been detected upon review.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Commonalities among all three logos -->
    <h2>Commonalities among all three logos:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each of the three logos employs white lettering.</li>
        <li>The text in all three logos are presented in uppercase. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sketches">Logo Sketches</h3>
<p class="brainstorming">Following an extensive brainstorming session for logo ideas, I created three pages of diverse designs for the client's review. The owner narrowed down the options to one preferred logo style but requested several iterations within that design. Consequently, I produced multiple versions with different icon placements, visual arrangements, and border styles to further explore and refine the chosen design direction.</p>

<!-- Color Selection -->
<h2>Color Selection</h2>
<p>The color scheme for Be Ready Fitness underwent various transformations and explorations. Initially, the client considered incorporating blue, yellow, red, white, and black colors without a specific primary choice. Upon researching competitors' logos, we found that blue was a popular color among local gyms.</p>
<p>After experimenting with different color placements, the client opted for simplicity. The final choice narrowed down to a refined palette consisting of black and white as primary colors, accented by a bold touch of red.</p>

<!-- Typography -->
<h2>Typography</h2>
<p> Once the color scheme had been finalized, the focus shifted towards selecting the ideal font for the new logo. The client expressed the need for a versatile font that could adapt seamlessly to various sizes across different formats while ensuring readability. Our process began with exploring several font options, gradually narrowing down the choices to Arial, Foco, and Tahoma. We experimented with these fonts on various logo concepts inspired by the initial sketches, seeking the right match that resonated with the brand's visual identity.</p>

<h2>Preference Testing </h2>
<p>After creating multiple logo variations, I engaged in preference testing to collect feedback. This evaluation was meticulously divided into sections focused on individual elements: preferred icons, font choices, and favored borders. Here are the insights gathered from this structured testing approach: </p>

<p>Which icon do you like better for a fitness logo? </p> 

 <p>Which placement of the icon do you like better?</p>

 <p>Which border do you perfer on this logo?</p>

 <p>Which font do you like better?</p>

 <p>The evolution of the logo style continued as we refined the color palette and strategized its versatile application. By eliminating the needle from the image, the wedge became a distinct feature, simplifying the design into easily manageable shapes and enhancing its adaptability </p>

<p> Following several rounds of revisions, I brought forward three distinct logo designs to the client, providing him with the opportunity to select the one that best embodied his business's identity. </p>

<h2>Final Result </h2>
<p> Once the client selected their preferred logo design, I showcased its adaptability by creating mockups on various items like sweatshirts, business cards, and marketing materials. This provided the client with a comprehensive visual representation of how the logo would appear across different sizes and mediums, helping them understand its versatility. </p>

<h2>Client Follow-Up </h2>
<p> A few weeks later, I arranged a follow-up meeting with the owner to ensure that the logo fulfilled his expectations and was easily usable for his needs. During our meeting, he proudly showcased the recently installed street and store signs featuring the logo design </p>
