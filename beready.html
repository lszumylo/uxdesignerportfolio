<h2 class="prob">The Problem</h2>
 </div>

<p class="example">The owner approached me with a request to craft a company logo that resonates with his current clientele. He's in need of a logo that not only stands out prominently on the plaza sign but also retains its visual appeal when scaled down for business cards, marketing materials, and apparel.</p>

<h2 class="resolution">The Solution</h2>

 <p class="proposal">Craft a company logo that embodies the essence of quality workouts and embodies the achievement of client goals within busy schedules.</p>

<h3 class="market-research">Competitive Analysis</h3> 

<p class="insight">
To initiate my research, I extensively investigated multiple personal training studios and gyms in Bedford. I conducted a close examination of their logos, color schemes, and typography. Once I honed in on the 3 most pertinent businesses, I crafted a competitive analysis. This method provided insights into distinct patterns and facilitated an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses inherent in each logo design.</p>

<h3 class="sketches">Logo Sketches</h3>
<p class="brainstorming">After presenting three logo pages featuring different ideas, the client selected a particular style and requested further exploration within that chosen direction. In response, I crafted three additional variations specifically within that preferred style, incorporating various icons, placements, and border styles to meet the client's request for more ideas within the selected theme.</p>

  <h2 class="colors">Color Selection</h2>

  <p class="scheme">Be Ready Fitness' color scheme underwent a series of transformations and explorations. Initially, the client entertained the idea of integrating a wide spectrum of colors - blue, yellow, red, white, and black - without a clear primary choice. Upon thorough research into competitors' logos, we discovered that blue held significant popularity among local gyms.</p>

<p>As we explored the refinement of the palette, the client was drawn towards simplicity. The final choice centered on a polished palette, focusing on black and white as primary colors, complemented by a striking touch of red.</p>

<h2 class="font">Typography</h2>

 <p class="type"> Once the color scheme had been finalized, the focus shifted towards selecting the ideal font for the new logo. The client expressed the need for a versatile font that could adapt seamlessly to various sizes across different formats while ensuring readability. My process began with exploring several font options, gradually narrowing down the choices to Arial, Average, Foco, and Tahoma. I experimented with these fonts on various logo concepts inspired by the initial sketches, seeking the right match that resonated with the brand's visual identity.</p>

<p class="collaborate"> Having collaborated closely with the client to finalize the color scheme and typography, the subsequent step involved synthesizing these chosen components. With the client's preferences in mind, the focus shifted towards merging the selected color palette and typography into a cohesive design, striving for a unified and impactful visual representation.</p>

<h2 class="ab testing">Preference Testing</h2>
 
<p> Following the creation of multiple logo variations, I conducted an in-depth preference testing session with 7 participants aimed at gathering extensive feedback. This systematic evaluation was methodically divided into sections, each specifically addressing elements such as preferred icons, font choices, and favored borders. The insights derived from this structured testing approach provide crucial guidance for refining the design.</p>

<p>Which icon do you like better for a fitness logo?</p>

<p>Which placement of the icon do you like better?</p>

<p>Which border do you prefer on this logo?</p>

<p>Which font do you like better?</p>

<p>Drawing from the insights gathered during testing sessions, we gained valuable understanding of audience preferences. Throughout the logo evolution, strategically removing the needle from the image highlighted the wedge as a distinctive feature. This deliberate simplification streamlined the design into easily manageable shapes, significantly enhancing its adaptability and visual impact.</p>

<p>I presented three logo designs to the client, offering the opportunity to choose the one that best embodied his business's identity</p>

<br>
 
<h2 class="finalresult">Final Result</h2>
<p> Once the client selected their preferred logo design, I showcased its adaptability by creating mockups on various items like sweatshirts, business cards, and marketing materials. This provided the client with a comprehensive visual representation of how the logo would appear across different sizes and mediums, helping them understand its versatility. </p>

<h2 class="clientfollowup">Client Follow-Up </h2>
<p> A few weeks later, I arranged a follow-up meeting with the owner to ensure that the logo fulfilled his expectations and was easily usable for his needs. During our meeting, he proudly showcased the recently installed street and store signs featuring the logo design </p>
