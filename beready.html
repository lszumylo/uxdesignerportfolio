    <h2 class="prob">The Problem</h2>
</div>



<p class="example">The owner approached me with a request to craft a company logo that resonates with his current clientele. He's in need of a logo that not only stands out prominently on the plaza sign but also retains its visual appeal when scaled down for business cards, marketing materials, and apparel.</p>

    <h2 class="discovery-call__title">Client Discovery Call</h2>
    <p class="discovery-call__text">To gain deeper insights into the client's vision for the logo design, I organized a consultation meeting to explore his specific requirements and creative ideas. During our discussion, the client emphasized the unique nature of his studio, highlighting its commitment to providing personalized, one-on-one trainingâ€”a crucial aspect he desired reflected in the logo's design.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the client emphasized the studio's core values, particularly emphasizing efficient time utilization during training sessions to ensure an exceptional workout experience for every individual. Additionally, there was a strong interest in using the logo across a variety of fitness merchandise and apparel, envisioning its placement on items like foam rollers, massage balls, hats, and other fitness-related products. This strategy aimed to create a strong, consistent brand identity across various materials.</p>

<h3 class="market-research">Competitive Analysis</h3> 

<p class="insight">In gaining insight into the local fitness scene, I examined various personal training studios and gyms in Bedford. This involved a thorough analysis of their logos, color schemes, and typography. After selecting the three most relevant businesses, I proceeded with a competitive analysis. This approach unveiled patterns and aided in assessing the strengths and weaknesses inherent in each logo design.</p>

    <h3 class="sketches">Logo Sketches</h3>
    <p class="brainstorming">After familiarizing myself with various fitness logos in the local area, I began the creative process by sketching initial logo concepts inspired by fitness themes. Presenting those sketches to the client allowed me to gather his initial feedback and preferences. Following his review, the client expressed a distinct interest in a particular style and requested further exploration within that chosen direction.</p>

<p class="variations">In response to the client's preferences, I developed three additional iterations adhering to the favored style. These new variations were carefully crafted to incorporate different icons, placements, and border styles, precisely meeting the client's request within the selected theme. This iterative process aimed to refine and expand upon the initial concept while ensuring alignment with the client's vision and expectations.</p>

  <h2 class="colors">Color Selection</h2>

  <p class="scheme">Be Ready Fitness' color scheme underwent a series of transformations and explorations. Initially, the client entertained the idea of integrating a wide spectrum of colors - blue, yellow, red, white, and black - without a clear primary choice. Upon thorough research into competitors' logos, we discovered that blue held significant popularity among local gyms.</p>

  <p>As we explored the refinement of the palette, the client was drawn towards simplicity. The final choice centered on a polished palette, focusing on black and white as primary colors, complemented by a striking touch of red.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class="font">Typography</h2>
  
  <p class="type">After finalizing the color scheme, attention turned to choosing the ideal font for the new logo. The client emphasized the requirement for a versatile font that could maintain readability across different sizes and formats. To start, I explored several font options including Arial, Average, Foco, and Tahoma, gradually narrowing the selection down to Foco and Tahoma. I experimented with these fonts on multiple logo concepts inspired by the initial sketches, aiming to find the perfect match that aligned with the brand's visual identity.</p>

 <div>
  <h2 class="ab-testing">Preference Testing</h2>

  <p>To gather detailed feedback after creating multiple logo variations, I organized a comprehensive preference test involving 7 participants. This structured assessment was divided into sections that addressed preferred icons, font choices, and favored borders. The insights gained provide essential direction for refining the design.</p>

  <p>Which icon do you like better for a fitness logo?</p>
  <img src="images/A-B Test 1.jpg" alt="Comparison of fitness logo icons A vs B" class="icon-test">

<p>Which placement of the icon do you like better?</p>
<img src="images/A-B Test 2.jpg" alt="Icon placement A vs B" class="icon-placement">

<p>Which border do you prefer on this logo?</p>

<p>Which font do you like better?</p>
<img src="images/A-B Test 4.jpg" alt="Font choice A vs B" class="font-test">

<p>Utilizing the valuable insights gathered from testing sessions, we gained a profound understanding of audience preferences. Throughout the logo's evolution, purposefully removing the needle from the image emphasized the wedge as a standout feature. This intentional simplification streamlined the design into clean and manageable shapes, greatly enhancing its adaptability and visual impact.</p>

<p class="collaborate"> Having collaborated closely with the client to finalize the color scheme and typography, the subsequent step involved synthesizing these chosen components. With the client's preferences in mind, the focus shifted towards merging the selected color palette and typography into a cohesive design, striving for a unified and impactful visual representation.</p>



<p>I presented three logo designs to the client, offering the opportunity to choose the one that best embodied his business's identity</p>

<h2 class="finalresult">Final Result</h2>
<p> Once the client selected their preferred logo design, I showcased its adaptability by creating mockups on various items like sweatshirts, business cards, and marketing materials. This provided the client with a comprehensive visual representation of how the logo would appear across different sizes and mediums, helping them understand its versatility. </p>

<h2 class="clientfollowup">Client Follow-Up </h2>
<p> A few weeks later, I arranged a follow-up meeting with the owner to ensure that the logo fulfilled his expectations and was easily usable for his needs. During our meeting, he proudly showcased the recently installed street and store signs featuring the logo design </p>
