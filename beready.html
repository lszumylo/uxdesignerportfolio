<h2 class="prob">The Problem</h2>
 </div>

<p class="example">The owner approached me with a request to craft a company logo that resonates with their current clientele. He's in need of a logo that not only stands out prominently on the plaza sign but also retains its visual appeal when scaled down for business cards, marketing materials, and apparel.</p>

<h2 class="resolution">The Solution</h2>

 <p class="proposal">Craft a company logo that embodies the essence of quality workouts and embodies the achievement of client goals within busy schedules.</p>

<h3 class="market-research">Competitive Analysis</h3> 

<p class="insight">Initially, I gathered information about personal training studios and gyms in the Bedford area, exploring their logos, color schemes, and typography. I narrowed down the selection to the most relevant businesses, resulting in the following findings for my logo research.</p>

  <div>
<h3 class="sketches">Logo Sketches</h3>
<p class="brainstorming">Following an extensive brainstorming session for logo ideas, I created three pages of fitness inspired designs for the client's review. After the owner selected a preferred logo style and requested several iterations, I crafted a few versions with different icons, placements, and border styles. This process aimed to elevate and refine the chosen design direction.</p>

  <h2 class="colors">Color Selection</h2>

  <p class="scheme">Be Ready Fitness' color scheme underwent a series of transformations and explorations. Initially, the client entertained the idea of integrating a wide spectrum of colors - blue, yellow, red, white, and black - without a clear primary choice. Upon thorough research into competitors' logos, we discovered that blue held significant popularity among local gyms.</p>

<p>Through various experiments with color placements, the client ultimately gravitated towards simplicity. The final decision honed in on a refined palette, spotlighting black and white as primary colors, amplified by a bold touch of red</p>

<h2 class="font">Typography</h2>

 <p class="type"> Once the color scheme had been finalized, the focus shifted towards selecting the ideal font for the new logo. The client expressed the need for a versatile font that could adapt seamlessly to various sizes across different formats while ensuring readability. Our process began with exploring several font options, gradually narrowing down the choices to Arial, Foco, and Tahoma. We experimented with these fonts on various logo concepts inspired by the initial sketches, seeking the right match that resonated with the brand's visual identity.</p>

<h2>Preference Testing</h2>
<p>After creating multiple logo variations, I engaged in preference testing to collect feedback. This evaluation was meticulously divided into sections focused on individual elements: preferred icons, font choices, and favored borders. Here are the insights gathered from this structured testing approach:</p>

<p>Which icon do you like better for a fitness logo?</p>
<img src="images/A-B Test 1 .jpg" alt="Fitness logo icon A vs B" class="icon-test">

<p>Which placement of the icon do you like better?</p>
<img src="images/A-B Test 2.jpg" alt="Icon placement A vs B" class="icon-placement">

<p>Which border do you prefer on this logo?</p>

<p>Which font do you like better?</p>
<img src="images/A-B Test 4.jpg" alt="Font choice A vs B" class="font-test">

<p>The evolution of the logo style continued as we refined the color palette and strategized its versatile application. By eliminating the needle from the image, the wedge became a distinct feature, simplifying the design into easily manageable shapes and enhancing its adaptability.</p>

<p>Following several rounds of revisions, I brought forward three distinct logo designs to the client, providing him with the opportunity to select the one that best embodied his business's identity.</p>

<h2 class="finalization">Conclusion</h2>

<h2>Final Result </h2>
<p> Once the client selected their preferred logo design, I showcased its adaptability by creating mockups on various items like sweatshirts, business cards, and marketing materials. This provided the client with a comprehensive visual representation of how the logo would appear across different sizes and mediums, helping them understand its versatility. </p>




   
<h2>Client Follow-Up </h2>
<p> A few weeks later, I arranged a follow-up meeting with the owner to ensure that the logo fulfilled his expectations and was easily usable for his needs. During our meeting, he proudly showcased the recently installed street and store signs featuring the logo design </p>
